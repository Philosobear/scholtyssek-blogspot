[[xboxControllerClient]]
========================

This is an example implementation for integrating a xbox controller into a C program.
The code reads the controller values and stores them in the xboxCtrl struct.

The whole configuration for the controller is in the header file xboxController.h
Please look at the code to see how it works, it is really easy.
